# This demonstration shows you how to call methods on string objects.


# initialize some variables to play with
url = "www.engineering.usask.ca"

# # find the location of the first period in the url



# count the number of periods in the url



# remove white space



# count the number of characters in the url after removing "www."
# (!gotta be careful - donâ€™t just assume a function does what you think!)





# # # more methods:

# # .upper()

# # .lower()

# # .replace()
# # immutable, they create a copy



# # how do I know what kind of methods are out there? How do I know the syntax/usage?
