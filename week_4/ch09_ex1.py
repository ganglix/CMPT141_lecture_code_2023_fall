# Write Python code which asks a user to input a string from
# the console until it is identical to pre-defined string passcode.
# When this occurs, print the number of attempts made to
# enter the correct string. e.g. "3 attempt(s) made."

# passcode = "cmpt141"








# Bonous: another option to stop a while loop [not covered in the textbook]
