# Exercise 1

# Suppose you have a dictionary of survey responses:
# •keys are student names
# •values are favourite ice cream flavours (one of
# "chocolate", "vanilla", "strawberry")
# Write a function that takes a dictionary of survey responses
# and returns a new dictionary where:
# •keys are ice cream flavours
# •values are number of students with that favourite flavour

survey = {"Christopher": "vanilla",
          "Ty": "vanilla",
          "Muhammed": "chocolate",
          "Ani": "vanilla",
          "Gang": "chocolate"}

# def icecream_vote(survey):
#     """
#     Calculate the vote count for each ice cream flavor in a survey.
#     :param survey: dict, A dictionary representing the survey results with participant names as keys
#                    and their selected ice cream flavors as values.
#     :return: dict, A dictionary containing ice cream flavors as keys and the number of votes they received as values.
