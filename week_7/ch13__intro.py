# why testing



# check what the function is supposed to do vs. what the function actually does



# proactive - reactive



# pick a test case
# 1 most likely to cause an error/ fault
# 2 small - unit test



# test case example
# codelab
# example Codelab 2 question 51844
# firstName[0] + middleName[0] + lastName[0]
