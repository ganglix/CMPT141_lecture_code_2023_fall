# Part (a) Change the list into a 2D array


# Part (b) Print the dimensions of the wind farm


# Part (c) Print the power output of the first turbine in the fifth row


# Part (d) Print the average power produced by
# the first three turbines in the first row


# Part (e) Print each turbineâ€™s power output, one per line





# things I want to mention for-loop iterator ( use index, use row, use item after reshape)
