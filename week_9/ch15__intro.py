# recursion

# find the solution of a problem
# solution is simply related to the solution of a reduced form of the problem

# how a problem can be reduced: reduce its size, step, number



# def is_even(number):
#     # to check if a positive number is even
















# recursion depth

#         is_even(i)
#     except:
#         print(f"max recursion number reached: {i}")
